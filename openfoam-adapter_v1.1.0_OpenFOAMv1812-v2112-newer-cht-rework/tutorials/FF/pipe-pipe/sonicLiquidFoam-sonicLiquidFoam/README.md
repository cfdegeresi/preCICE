# Tutorial for partitioned Fluid simulation using sonicLiquidFoam

This tutorial is currently used as a workbench for testing and extending the fluid-fluid module of the adapter. It is only meant as a starting point and not as a validated simulation at the moment.

In this case, both subdomains are simulated with the incompressible solver pimpleFoam. In the same directory, you can also find a similar case based on the incompressible solver pimpleFoam.

There is currently no additional documentation for this tutorial.
